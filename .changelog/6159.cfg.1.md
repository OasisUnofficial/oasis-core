Add configurable CID pool

The node's CID pool for allocating CIDs to TDX virtual machines can now be
configured in the node configuration as follows:

```yaml
runtime:
  tdx:
    cid_start: 123
    cid_count: 1000
```

This allows one to run multiple node instances with non-overlapping CID
ranges.
