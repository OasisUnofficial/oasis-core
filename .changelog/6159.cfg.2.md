Move runtime SGX loader configuration

The configuration option `runtime.sgx_loader` has been moved to
`runtime.sgx.loader`. The old option has been deprecated and support may
be removed in a future release.

The new SGX loader configuration can look as follows:

```yaml
runtime:
  sgx:
    loader: /srv/node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader
```
