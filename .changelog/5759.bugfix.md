go/runtime/registry/host: Ignore key manager quote policy update feature

If the key manager policy and status update watcher started before
the runtime active version was ready, it failed to fetch the runtime
info and stopped. Therefore, the key manager status and quote policy
were never updated, causing the key manager runtime client to reject
incoming Noise session requests since the policy was not set.
