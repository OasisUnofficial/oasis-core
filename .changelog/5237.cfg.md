Configuration file migration

To migrate your node's YAML config file from the old format
to the new, you can use the node's `config migrate` subcommand.
Pass the path to the old config file with `--in` and specify
the new config file name with `--out`.

For example:
`oasis-node config migrate --in old.yaml --out new.yaml`.

The migration subcommand logs the various changes it makes and
warns you if a config option is no longer supported, etc.
At the end, any unknown sections of the input config file are
printed to the terminal to give you a chance to review them
and make manual changes if required.

Note that the migration subcommand does not preserve comments
and order of sections from the input YAML config file.
You should always carefully read the output of this command,
as well as compare the generated config file with the
original before using it.
