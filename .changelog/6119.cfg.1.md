Add component permissions

Each component can be granted special permissions in the configuration file
as follows:

```yaml
runtime:
  # ... other fields omitted ...
  runtimes:
    - id: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a6d1e3ebf60dff6c
      components:
        - id: rofl.rofl1qrqw99h0f7az3hwt2cl7yeew3wtz0fxunu7luyfg
          permissions:
            - bundle_add
            - bundle_remove
```

The currently available permissions are:

- `bundle_add` to allow the component to add bundles to the host node.
- `bundle_remove` to allow the component to remove bundles from the host node.

Other permissions may be added in the future.
