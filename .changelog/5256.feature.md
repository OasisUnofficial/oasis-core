go/control/api: Improve node registration status clarity

Three new fields have been added to the node's control status output
under the registration status section:

- `last_attempt_successful` - true if the last registration attempt
succeeded.
- `last_attempt_error_message` - error message if the last registration
attempt failed.
- `last_attempt` - time of the last registration attempt.

Also, if the registration descriptor is expired, it is no longer
shown in the output.
