keymanager/src/runtime: Support master secret rotations

Key managers now have the ability to rotate the master secret
at predetermined intervals. Each rotation introduces a new generation,
or version, of the master secret that is sequentially numbered, starting
from zero. These rotations occur during key manager status updates, which
typically happen during epoch transitions. To perform a rotation,
one of the key manager enclaves must publish a proposal for the next
generation of the master secret, which must then be replicated by
the majority of enclaves. If the replication process is not completed
by the end of the epoch, the proposal can be replaced with a new one.
