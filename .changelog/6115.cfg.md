go/consensus/cometbft/config: Move light client config

The consensus light client is currently used only for consensus state
synchronization. However, in the future, stateless clients will also rely
on it. Therefore, we have moved the trust root configuration to a dedicated
section.

The following configuration options have been removed:

- `consensus.state_sync.trust_period`,

- `consensus.state_sync.trust_height`,

- `consensus.state_sync.trust_hash`.

The following configuration options have been added:

- `consensus.light_client.trust.period`,

- `consensus.light_client.trust.height`,

- `consensus.light_client.trust.hash`.
