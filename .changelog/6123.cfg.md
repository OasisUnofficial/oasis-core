Add support for simple per-component networking

One can now configure incoming connection forwarding to the guest for each
component as follows:

```yaml
runtime:
  runtimes:
    - id: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a6d1e3ebf60dff6c
      components:
        - id: rofl.rofl1...
          networking:
            incoming:
              - ip: 1.2.3.4
                protocol: tcp
                src_port: 1234
                dst_port: 5678
```
