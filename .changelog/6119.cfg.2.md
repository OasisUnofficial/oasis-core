Add support for per-component local configuration

Each component can now have its own local configuration specified in the
configuration file as follows:

```yaml
runtime:
  # ... other fields omitted ...
  runtimes:
    - id: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a6d1e3ebf60dff6c
      components:
        - id: rofl.rofl1qrqw99h0f7az3hwt2cl7yeew3wtz0fxunu7luyfg
          config:
            my_custom_entry: 42
```

The old per-runtime configuration is _deprecated_ but is used for the RONL
component in case it is not overriden in the `components` section.
