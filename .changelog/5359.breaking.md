roothash: Store past runtime state and I/O roots in consensus state

A new roothash consensus parameter was added (`MaxPastRootsStored`),
which enables storing runtime state and I/O roots for the past
`MaxPastRootsStored` rounds in the consensus state.
This enables easier cross-runtime communication.
