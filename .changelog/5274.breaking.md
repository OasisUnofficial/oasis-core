go/roothash: Optimize and refactor commitment pool processing

The commitment pool processing has been optimized and refactored to improve
code readability:

- The discrepancy detection has been modified to immediately switch to
  the resolution mode when two commits differ, eliminating the necessity
  to wait for the proposer's commitment.

- The discrepancy resolution process was redesigned to fail as soon
  as it becomes evident that no group of votes can attain the majority,
  such as when there are too many failures.
