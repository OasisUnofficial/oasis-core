Implement ROFL (Runtime OFf-chain Logic)

This extends runtimes with support for arbitrary off-chain logic that uses
the existing decentralized execution, distribution and remote attestation
infrastructure provided by Oasis. See [ADR 24] for more details.

Use cases include oracles, bridges, light clients, complex data workloads,
intent solvers, autonomous AI agents, etc.
