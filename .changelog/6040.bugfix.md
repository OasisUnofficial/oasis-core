go/consensus/cometbft: Fail ImmutableState creation if version is missing

Previously, when an `ImmutableState` was requested for a block version that
didn't exist, the function would silently default to the latest available
block. This could lead to inconsistencies since clients might receive state
for a different block than expected. With this change, calls to create
an `ImmutableState` for a missing version now explicitly fail with a
"version not found" error, ensuring that such cases are handled properly.
