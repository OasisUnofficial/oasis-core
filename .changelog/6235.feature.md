go/consensus/cometbft: Add stateless client node

A stateless client node can now be started using the following configuration.
To ensure compatibility, all provider nodes specified must be running
the latest version of Oasis Core.

```yaml
mode: client-stateless
# ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
consensus:
    providers:
        - <node-address-1>
        - <node-address-2>
        # Add more node addresses as needed
```
