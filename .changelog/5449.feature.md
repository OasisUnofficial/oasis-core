go/oasis-node/cmd/genesis: Make attestation age/interval configurable

A new flag `registry.tee_features.sgx.default_max_attestation_age` was added
to the genesis command to specify the default maximum attestation age when
SGX RAK-signed attestations are enabled. Additionally, within the runtime
registry configuration, one can now set the attestation interval for periodic
runtime re-attestation.
