go/oasis-node/cmd/config: Add the migrate subcommand

A new `migrate` subcommand is added to the node's `config`
command.  This subcommand can be used to automatically migrate
the old YAML config file into the new format introduced in
commit 2a132b3.

The subcommand logs the various changes it makes and warns the
user if a config option is no longer supported, etc.
At the end, any unknown sections of the input config file are
printed to the terminal to give the user a chance to review
them and make manual changes if appropriate.
