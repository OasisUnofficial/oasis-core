go/worker/compute/executor/committee: Support backup proposers

Starting now, all executor committee workers are permitted to schedule
transactions, each with distinct per-round priority. Priority dictates
the time after which a worker can propose a new batch. The consensus
layer tracks all published executor commitments and tries to build
a new runtime block on a proposal with the highest priority.
