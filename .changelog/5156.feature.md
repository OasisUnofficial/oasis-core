runtime/src/enclave_rpc: Support calls to explicit key manager members

Key manager enclaves can now request a host to talk not only to a randomly
chosen key manager instance, but also to a specific instance. The identity
of the remote node is verified only in Noise sessions. In these, the enclave
obtains the other instance's trusted RAK from the consensus layer and compares
it to the one used throughout the session.
