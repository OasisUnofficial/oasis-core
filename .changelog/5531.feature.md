Support for Proofs Without Implicit Internal Leaf Nodes

Previously, internal MKVS nodes in proofs included full leaf nodes implicitly.
With this update, leaf nodes are explicitly added as regular child nodes
within the proof structure. This modification optimizes proof sizes by
avoiding inclusion of potentially large values associated with leaf nodes that
are not directly relevant to the proof's target node.

This change maintains backward compatibility. Existing proofs are unmarshaled
as version 0, while version 1 proofs adopt the new scheme.
