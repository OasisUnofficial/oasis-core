go/consensus/cometbft/light: Lazy initialize light client

To initialize the CometBFT light client, a valid trusted light block is
required. However, if no peers are available at startup or if the available
peers do not have the requested light block, initialization fails.
This causes consensus state synchronization from a checkpoint to fail,
and the node must be restarted. To address this issue, we implemented
lazy initialization for the client. If initialization fails initially,
the system will retry initialization on subsequent requests.
