The pathbadger storage backend is now the default for new nodes

When a node is provisioned into an empty data directory it will default to
using the `pathbadger` storage backend.

For existing nodes, the storage backend is automatically detected based on
the data directory. When multiple storage directories exist, the one most
recently modified is used.

In case one does not want this new behavior, it is still possible to set
the `storage.backend` to `badger`/`pathbadger` to explicitly configure the
desired storage backend and disable autodetection.
