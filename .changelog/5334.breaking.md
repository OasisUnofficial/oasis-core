go/consensus/roothash: Track runtime proposer liveness

The roothash application now monitors the runtime proposer liveness, which
runtimes can utilize to penalize proposers with insufficient commitments.
To activate penalties for such nodes, the executor committee parameters
need to be updated by configuring the following setting:

- `MaxMissedProposalsPercent`: The maximum percentage of proposed rounds
  in an epoch that can fail for a node to be considered live. Zero means
  that all proposed rounds can fail.
