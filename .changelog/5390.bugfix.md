host/sgx/epid: ensure consistent IAS proxy usage for attestation

Refactors the IAS proxy client to expose separate clients for each configured
IAS proxy, instead of load-balancing internally between endpoints on a
per-request basis.

This is required because the attestation procedure requires three calls to
the IAS endpoint (`GetSPIDInfo`, `GetSigRL`, `VerifyEvidence`) which should
all interact with the same endpoint.
