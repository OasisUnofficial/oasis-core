go/storage: Add automatic storage backend detection

The new default storage backend is "auto" which attempts to detect the
storage backend that should be used based on existing data directories.
When none exist, "pathbadger" is used. When multiple exist, the most
recently modified one is used.

This should make newly deployed nodes default to pathbadger.
