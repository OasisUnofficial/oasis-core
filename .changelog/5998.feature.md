go/oasis-node: Display runtime block history indexer status

A new field `indexer` has been added to the `oasis-node control status`
output under the runtime status section. Unless keymanager runtime,
this field displays:

 1. The status of runtime block history indexer.
 2. The last indexed round.

Additionally, if history reindex is in progress, it also includes:

- Batch size that is used during reindex.
- Last consensus height that was indexed.
- Start and end heights of reindex range.
- ETA field, which specifies expected time of reindex completion.

This is useful for the node operators, so that they can estimate when their
node will be ready to accept runtime work.
